![Fullstack Developer | Software Engineer](https://img.shields.io/badge/Fullstack_Developer-Software_Engineer-blue)

I'm a software engineer coding in JS and Python. I'm passionate about art, coding, comics, etc and open to collabrate!
I work on web development, creating frontend, backend, and full stack applications. I design features and improve functionality in old ones. I'm innovative, creating new solutions for problems when needed, I'm co-operative, listening and working on a project in a team, and I'm dependable, working through problems and meeting a task.
